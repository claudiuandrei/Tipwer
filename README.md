# Pre-work - *Tipwer*

**Tipwer** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Claudiu Andrei**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Automatic tip value selections by country.
- [x] Simpler tip input, similar with Venmo.

## Notes

The biggest challenge with building the app was to get aquainted with iOS aproach and APIs. I assumed that will take me a couple of hours after seeing the tutorial but it ended up taking way longer.
